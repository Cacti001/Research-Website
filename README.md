# - Life Sciences Researcher | Aspiring PhD Candidate

Welcome to my personal website! I am Raima Sing, a Life Sciences researcher with a focus on ion channels and neurodegeneration. With an Integrated MSc in Life Sciences from the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar, India, I am passionate about advancing our understanding of how ion channels, especially TRP channels, play a critical role in brain health and disease.

Currently, I am investigating the regulation of microglial iron homeostasis and its implications for neurodegenerative diseases. My research combines cutting-edge techniques like confocal microscopy, cell culture, and live-cell imaging to uncover novel insights into cellular function and disease mechanisms.

In addition to my research, I am also an active participant in the scientific community, with contributions to conferences, workshops, and publications. I am always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to the broader scientific conversation through my research and service activities.
